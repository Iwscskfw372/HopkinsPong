All configuration files are to be kept in this directory.
For security reasons we did not include a config.js file in this repo. To make this app work you must craete a config.js file inside of the config folder.
The file should have one line for the variable module.exports.databaseURI and that should equal your FULL db connect url. It should look something like "mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER".
